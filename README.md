# Fins FAQ
A simple page to track questions that are inevitably asked by viewers of IM [John Bartholomew](http://youtube.com/johnbartholomewchess)'s chess streams, every single time.

# More details
So, a little bird told me that this got posted on the [r/chess](http://reddit.com/r/chess) subreddit. That's why I'm updating the readme with a little more details because there will be reddit folks who WILL look here in the repo, given the prominent github url. 

Things to note:

1. This is NOT representative of my work/coding skill. I made it super quickly one day because [AntonSquaredMe](http://twitter.com/AntonSquaredMe) joked on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AntonSquaredMe/status/700356395279867904) (hours before a scheduled stream) that a bunch of new fans will be asking John about his username Fins and his background chess piece, *again*. So I put together something simple we can link to people in chat, for the questions that literally get asked *every time*.
2. That said, this has since become my little Jekyll learning playground since it was created. I went from not knowing much about it, to feeling like I can do many things with it! One day, it'll be cleaned up enough so that it is something I can be proud of :D
3. Even though I started it, I want to give a huge shoutout to [AntonSquaredMe](http://twitter.com/AntonSquaredMe) who helped with adding questions, and cleaning up my content. Thanks buddy!
4. Questions/comments/other? You can find me on twitter: [@kozzi](http://twitter.com/kozzi). Please be nice.

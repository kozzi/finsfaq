## CHESS IMPROVEMENT

#### What should I do as an adult beginner to get better at chess?
Set modest goals, play a lot, & analyze your own games before using an engine. ([Source](https://youtu.be/dpSYSZ9nqgk?t=2h26m59s))

#### What should I do to get better at calculation?
Play a lot of standard games (15 minute games with a 10 second increment or longer) and analyze them. ([Source](https://youtu.be/dpSYSZ9nqgk?t=2h33m50s)) Also, study your tactics and check the book section for some recommendations. ([Source](https://youtu.be/ebEOIi-tcBg?t=40m24s))

#### When you analyze/study a game, what steps do you go through?
With your own games, John likes a 3-part process:

1. After you finish, write down your thoughts on the game and do a quick analysis of the game's big moments.
2. After some time, come back to the game and do some hardcore analysis.
3. Check your work with an engine. ([Source](https://youtu.be/ebEOIi-tcBg?t=23m40s))
